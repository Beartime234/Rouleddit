# Rouleddit (Reddit Roulette)

Reddit Roulette is a online interactive community game based on the fundamentel rules of Roulette with a Reddit twist. 

Instead of betting on what number is drawn a random top post from Reddit is chosen from one of the top subreddits. You bet on what you think the first letter will be.

Rouleddit has a standard mode which you can play endlessly (until you run out of points), the daily mode where you play aganist all of reddit. Along with a daily gift
just in case you run out of points!

## How to Play

It's pretty simple just place a bet on what letter which you think will be first in the random post. 

You can bet on it being a single letter, a range of letters (A -> I) or even more unique bets such as vowels and consonants. After placing your bet A random subreddit and top post from that week for that subreddit will be chosen. If you guessed correctly you win your points back with the corresponding multiplier.

Aim to get as many points as you can to climb the leaderboard. The top five playes get a unique flair based on their rank.
