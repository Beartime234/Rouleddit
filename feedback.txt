The Menu Actions should show a scrollbar omg I thought for ages it wasnt working but it was hidden in the scroll

Font really needs to be supported AHHH in blocks!

Customization - I guess thats what Webview is for but i think blocks is ok for 90% of things

Using the richtextbuilder is so hard and examples needd to exist

I tried to use the makeFormatting but i really had no clue where to start

User input needs more customization - you can really only go is it a string? I know you can validate after the fact but thats not super great
